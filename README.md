# Pepperdisease-identification-Using-DL

Problem Statement: Developed an algorithm to automatically identify diseases in pepper plants using deep learning techniques.

2. Data Collection:  A dataset of labeled images from kaggle representing healthy and diseased pepper plant are used in this purpose.

3. Model Architecture: 
   - Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically tailored for image classification tasks.
   - Utilized multiple layers (convolutional, pooling, fully connected) to automatically extract and learn relevant features from the input images.

4. Model Training:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Trained the CNN model using backpropagation and optimization techniques like stochastic gradient descent.
   - Applied data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model robustness.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Assessed the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and diseased plants, as well as correctly identifying specific diseases.

6. Skills Demonstrated:
   - Proficient use of Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Expertise in image processing, CNN architecture design, model training, and validation.
   - Application of machine learning principles to a practical agricultural problem.
